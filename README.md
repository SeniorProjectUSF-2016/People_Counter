# VideoSurveilance
Uses the FindPedestrian.find function with each frame to count the number of moving pedestrians in front of the camera. Also outputs a counter value to the console every time a red box is detected ( a pedestrian is detected). Most basic, still needs some understanding on what factors it takes to determine whether a pedestrian or not. But this is the most basic "working" counter.
